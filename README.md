# SDG: A Simplified and Dynamic Graph Neural Network
This repository is for the SIGIR' 2021 paper "SDG: A Simplified and Dynamic Graph Neural Network" ([Link](https://dongqifu.github.io/publications/SDG.pdf)).

## Functionality
Given the graph data and its updates, SDG could produce updated node representations via the dynamic propagation scheme.

## Reference
If you use the materials from this repositiory, please refer to our paper.
